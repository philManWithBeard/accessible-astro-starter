# Growing Safety: Cultivating Biodiversity and Natural Security

The Growing Safety Project is an innovative initiative combining environmental stewardship with community safety. By planting native, prickly hedgerows, we aim to create valuable wildlife habitats while simultaneously enhancing the security of homes and public spaces.

## The Power of Prickles

Prickly hedges, composed of species like hawthorn, blackthorn, and holly, offer a multitude of benefits:

- Wildlife Haven: Dense, thorny hedges provide shelter and nesting sites for birds, small mammals, and beneficial insects. Berries and blossoms offer vital food sources, supporting a thriving ecosystem.
- Natural Deterrent: Thick, prickly hedges form a formidable barrier, discouraging intruders and reducing opportunities for crime. It's a beautiful, eco-friendly alternative to fences or walls.
- Improved Air Quality and Noise Reduction: Hedges act as natural filters, trapping pollutants and reducing noise for a more peaceful environment.
- Enhanced Aesthetics: Flowering hedges add colour and texture to the landscape, boosting the visual appeal of our neighbourhoods.

## How the Project Works

The Growing Safety Project involves collaboration between residents and volunteers. We work together to:

- Identify Suitable Locations: Areas such as property boundaries, underutilised green spaces, and along walkways are ideal for prickly hedges.
- Source Native Plants: We partner with local nurseries to provide young plants of appropriate species.
- Organise Planting Events: Community planting days offer opportunities for residents to get involved in transforming their neighbourhoods.
- Provide Ongoing Guidance: We share information on care and maintenance of the hedges to ensure long-term success.

## Get Involved

We welcome volunteers and anyone passionate about improving their community. Here's how you can participate:

- Volunteer for Planting Days: Lend a hand in bringing these beneficial hedges to life.
- Spread the Word: Share the Growing Safety Project with neighbours and community groups.
